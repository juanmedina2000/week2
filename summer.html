    how to pick ripe watermelon:</h2>
    <img src= "watermelon.jpg" alt= "this is watermelon">
    <p>Watermelon should be firm and symmetrical, without bruises, cuts, or dents.</br>
      It should feel heavy for its size and have a creamy yellow spot where the melon sat on the ground to ripen in the sun.
      </br>Precut melon flesh should be dense, firm, and appear moist.
